# My-Refocus-Assignments

My name is Prince Oncada and I am an aspiring web developer.
My hobbies include reading, coding, working out, and eating good food.
My goal for the upcoming year is to finish this course and to procure a career as a web developer.
My reason to be a web developer is to further develop my interest in coding.
